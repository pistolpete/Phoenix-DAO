Overview
The first grant making/issuing organization for stratis.

Solving issues related to the funding of public goods on the stratis blockchain ecosystem

You need to be voted on by existing members

When a person deposits stratsyou get votes proportional to the total amount deposited

 Once you get votes I. You can vote on other new proposals or grants

If at any point you don't like how the grant funding is going , or who is being admitted ECT. You can execute a function called " relinquish rights"

Relinquish rights = exit with your proprtional share of all remaining money

Voting period of 7 days(subject to change) once your proposal is submitted, you will get your answer after 7 days

2 contracts - a governance contract and a syndicate bank

In order to join you need an existing members to submit a proposal

When submitting a proposal there are 2 things needed, 1.the amount of "tribute" willing to give in strat and 2. The amount of shares that are being requested

The amount of shares requested will be newly minted

The only difference between a grant proposal and a membership proposal is that the tribute would be set to zero if it's a grant

If you are working for the doa you do not need to give money, but if you want to join as a member and are joining with capital then you need to offer a tribute

Grants are proportionately paid by diluting all existing members

There is no quorom. If only 1 vote is placed that is enough to pass. 

After initial 7 day voting period there is a 7 day grace period where any member who is not happy with how any vote went may "relinquish rights"  and then are not on the hook for the grant

If grant is passed and the person requested 10 shares and there are currently 100 shares.  Those 10 shares will be newly minted and the person will receive 10 out of 110 shared. So again grants are proportionately paid by diluting all existing members

The only circumstance in which you cannot leave is if you have any yes votes pending.

If more than 2/3 of members relinquish their rights the pending contracts are void

There are no upgrade mechanisms, in order to upgrade a new contract must written and everyone relinquish rights and join new contract

When submitting a proposal you need to spend 100 strat as a deposit which will get returned following the 2 week period. This is to avoid spamming the network with proposals

5 new proposals per day max - 35 total a week
